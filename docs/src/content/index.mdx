# Introduction

**Betterlytics** is a cookieless, privacy-first analytics platform. It tracks website traffic without cookies, personal data, or cross-site tracking, and is designed to be GDPR, CCPA, and PECR ready out of the box. The tracking script is under 2KB and loads asynchronously to avoid impacting page performance.

You can run Betterlytics as a [managed cloud service](/installation/cloud-hosting) or [self-host](/installation/self-hosting) it on your own infrastructure. See the [Installation Overview](/installation) for a full comparison.

## What You Can Track

Betterlytics covers core web analytics and performance monitoring in a single platform:

- **Traffic and audience** - Visitors, pageviews, bounce rate, scroll depth, visit duration, referrers, UTM campaigns, geography, and device breakdown
- **Behavior and conversions** - User journeys, conversion funnels, custom events, and outbound link tracking
- **Performance monitoring** - Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB), uptime monitoring, SSL certificate checks, and scheduled email reports
- **Session replay** - Replay visitor sessions with event timelines and privacy-first masking (cloud only)

All data is available in real time through the [dashboard](/dashboard), with support for filtering across any dimension.
