## How Our Billing Works

### Monthly Billing Cycles

- **Billing Period**: All paid plans are billed monthly on the same date each month
- **Usage Reset**: Your event count resets to zero at the start of each billing cycle
- **No Rollover**: Unused events don't carry over to the next month
- **Proration**: Plan changes are prorated when you upgrade or downgrade mid-cycle

### Event Counting

**What counts as an event?**

- Each page view on your website with our tracking script
- Any custom events that you send to our API
- We automatically filter out bot traffic and spam, these DO NOT count towards your event limit

### Payment Processing

We use **Stripe** for secure payment processing, which means:

- **Secure Payment**: Industry-standard encryption and security
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Credit cards, bank transfers, and more
- **Global Support**: Accepts payments from customers worldwide
- **Automatic Billing**: No need to manually pay each month
- **Easy Management**: Update payment methods and view invoices anytime

There is no usage based pricing, you pay a fixed price for your plan and you can upgrade, downgrade or cancel at any time.
