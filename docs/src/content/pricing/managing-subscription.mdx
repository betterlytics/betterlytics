# Managing Your Subscription

Once you have a paid Betterlytics subscription, you can manage all aspects of your billing through Stripe Customer Portal. This guide covers everything you need to know about subscription management.

## Accessing Your Billing Portal

1. **Log into your Betterlytics account**
2. **Go to your user settings** by clicking your User avatar in the top right corner and selecting "Settings"
3. **Click "Billing"** to access your subscription management tab
4. **Click "Open Billing Portal"** to access your subscription management

</div>

Alternatively, you can access your billing portal by navigating to [https://betterlytics.io/billing](https://betterlytics.io/billing) and clicking "Open Billing Portal" in your current plan card.

## Understanding Your Current Plan

You can view your current plan and usage in your user settings in the "Usage" tab.

The usage tab shows the following information:

- **Current plan tier** (Growth or Professional)
- **Monthly price** and billing currency
- **Event usage** for the current period
- **Days until next billing cycle**
- **Subscription status** (Active, Canceled, etc.)

  **Important:** If you downgrade your plan from Professional to Growth, you'll
  lose access to the additional dashboards that you created in the Professional
  plan. You'll also risk your data retention period being reduced to 1 year and
  any data older than 1 year will be deleted.

## Viewing Invoices and Billing History

### Accessing Your Invoices

Through the Stripe Customer Portal, you can:

1. **View all past invoices** with detailed breakdowns
2. **Download PDF copies** for accounting purposes
3. **See payment history** and transaction details
4. **Track proration adjustments** from plan changes

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  ![Stripe portal showing invoice
  history](/images/billing/access-subscription-management.png)
</div>

Each invoice includes the following information:

- **Billing period** covered
- **Plan name** and **plan event limits**
- **Prorations** from mid-cycle plan changes
- **Tax information** (where applicable)
- **Payment method** used

## Updating Payment Methods

### Adding New Payment Methods

1. **Access Stripe Customer Portal**
2. **Go to "Payment Methods" section**
3. **Click "Add Payment Method"**
4. **Enter your new card or bank details**
5. **Set as default** if desired

### Changing Your Default Payment Method

1. **View your existing payment methods**
2. **Click "Set as Default"** next to your preferred method
3. **Future bills will use** the new default method
4. **Old payment method remains** as backup unless removed

### Failed Payment Recovery

If a payment fails:

- **You'll receive email notifications** from Stripe
- **Multiple retry attempts** are made automatically
- **Update your payment method** quickly to avoid service interruption
- **Contact support** if you need assistance resolving payment issues

## Subscription Status Management

### Active Subscriptions

As long as your subscription is active, you'll have full access to your plan features. If you cancel your subscription,
you'll lose access to your plan features at the end of your current billing period and you'll automatically be downgraded to the free Growth plan.

If you exceed your event limits, you'll be notified and you'll be able to upgrade your plan to avoid any restrictions. We provide grace periods and wonâ€™t immediately cut off service.
If you repeatedly exceed your event limits, you'll risk your excessive tracked data being deleted and your account will be at risk of suspension.
