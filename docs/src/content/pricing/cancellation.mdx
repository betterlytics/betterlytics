# Cancelling Your Subscription

We're sorry to see you considering cancellation. This guide explains the cancellation process, what happens to your account and data, and how you can reactivate if you change your mind.

## Before You Cancel

### Consider Your Options

Before cancelling, you might want to:

**Downgrade Instead of Cancel:**

- Switch to Growth plan if you're on Professional
- Reduce your event volume to lower costs
- Keep access to historical data and features

**Contact Support:**

- We may be able to help with billing issues
- Discuss custom solutions for specific needs
- Get assistance with plan optimization

## Cancellation Process

### Step 1: Access Cancellation Options

1. **Log into your Betterlytics account**
2. **Navigate to your current plan in user settings**
3. **Click "Cancel Subscription" button**
4. **Confirm your intention** to proceed to cancellation

</div>

### Step 2: Stripe Customer Portal

1. **You'll be redirected to Stripe Customer Portal** with cancellation options
2. **Choose "Cancel Subscription"** from the available actions
3. **Provide cancellation reason** (optional but helpful for us)
4. **Confirm cancellation** to complete the process

</div>

## What Happens After Cancellation

You'll retain access to all features and data until your billing cycle ends.
When your subscription fully expires, the following changes will occur:

- **Account is downgraded to free tier**
- **10,000 event limit** per month going forward
- **Limited to 1 dashboard** (additional dashboards becomes inaccessible)
- **Reduced data retention** (Growth plan limits apply)

**Data Retention:**

- **Historical data preserved** according to Growth plan retention (1+ year)
- **Recent analytics remain accessible** within free tier limits

  **Important Downgrade Impacts:** Any data older than 1 year is at risk of
  being deleted.
</Callout>

## Reactivating Your Subscription

If you want to reactivate before your billing period ends:

1. **Navigate to the usage tab in user settings**
2. **Click "Reactivate Subscription"**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Cancellation Questions

**Q: When does my cancellation take effect?**
A: You'll retain access until your next billing date.

**Q: Will I get a refund for unused time?**
A: No, we don't offer refunds for unused time. However, Stripe will automatically prorate your unused time if you decide to change plan instead of cancelling.

**Q: Can I reactivate the same plan later?**
A: Yes, you can reactivate or choose any available plan at any time. But note that historical data may have been lost if you've downgraded to the free plan.

### Data Questions

**Q: How long do you keep my data after cancellation?**
A: Data is retained according to Growth plan limits (1+ year) after cancellation. Professional retention periods don't continue after downgrade, this means that any data older than 1 year is at risk of being deleted.

**Q: Can I get my data deleted immediately?**
A: Yes, you can delete your account completely via user settings and all your data will be deleted. Alternatively you can contact support if you need immediate data deletion for privacy reasons. Both options are permanent and cannot be undone.
