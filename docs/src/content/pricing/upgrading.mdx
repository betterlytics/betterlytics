# Upgrading to a Paid Plan

Ready to scale beyond the free 10,000 events per month? This guide walks you through upgrading to a paid Growth or Professional plan.

## Before You Upgrade

### Check Your Current Usage

Before selecting a plan, review your current event usage:

1. **Log into your dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Billing** (if available) or check your subscription overview in your user settings
3. **Review your monthly event count** to understand your traffic patterns

## Step-by-Step Upgrade Process

### Step 1: Access the Billing Page

1. **Log into your Betterlytics account**
2. **Click Upgrade Plan in your User avatar in the top right corner** or visit directly at [https://betterlytics.io/billing](https://betterlytics.io/billing)
3. **You'll see your current plan and the pricing calculator** with different plans and event volume options

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  ![Billing page with pricing slider](/images/billing/pricing-calculator.png)
</div>

### Step 2: Select Your Plan and Volume

1. **Use the slider** to select your expected monthly event volume
2. **Choose between Growth and Professional** plans
3. **Select your preferred currency** (USD or EUR)
4. **Review the pricing** for your selected volume

The pricing updates automatically as you adjust the slider.

See our [Plan Overview](/pricing#plans-overview) page for the differences between the plans or our [Pricing](https://betterlytics.io/#pricing) page for the exact pricing.

### Step 3: Complete Payment Setup

1. **Click "Get Started" or "Upgrade"** on your chosen plan
2. **You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout** - our secure payment processor
3. **Enter your billing information:**
   - Email address (auto-filled)
   - Payment method (credit card, bank transfer, etc.)
   - Billing address
4. **Review your order** and confirm the subscription

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  ![Stripe checkout page](/images/billing/stripe-checkout.png)
</div>

### Step 4: Confirmation and Access

After successful payment:

1. **You'll be redirected back** to your Betterlytics dashboard
2. **Your plan will be active immediately** - no waiting period
3. **You'll receive a confirmation email** with your invoice
4. **Your new event limits take effect** immediately

## What Happens After Upgrading

Your plan will be active immediately and you'll be able to use all the features of your new plan. You'll also be able to access your billing portal to manage your subscription. Your subscription auto-renews monthly unless cancelled.

If you're upgrading mid-month, Stripe automatically prorates the unused time on your current plan and applies it as credit towards your new plan.

### Managing Your New Subscription

You can now access your billing portal to manage your subscription, view your invoices and more. You can also view your event usage in real-time in your user settings.

To access your billing portal, go to user settings and navigate to the "Billing" tab. Here you can view your invoices, manage your subscription and more.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>

</div>

View our [Managing Your Subscription](/pricing/managing-subscription) guide for more information on how to manage your subscription.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Payment Failed

If your payment doesn't go through:

1. **Check your payment method** - ensure sufficient funds and valid card details
2. **Try a different payment method** - Stripe supports multiple options
3. **Contact your bank** - some banks block online subscription payments
4. **Reach out to support** - maybe we can help resolve payment issues, but we can't guarantee it.

### Plan Not Activated

If your plan isn't active after payment:

1. **Check your email** for confirmation from Stripe
2. **Refresh your dashboard** - changes may take a moment to appear
3. **[Contact support](mailto:support@betterlytics.io)** if the issue persists

### Wrong Plan Selected

If you accidentally chose the wrong plan, don't worry, you can change plans immediately. Visit your billing page and select the correct plan. Stripe will automatically prorate the unused time on your current plan and apply it as credit towards your new plan.
In the event that you chose a plan that is too expensive for your usage, you can downgrade your plan at any time and we'll apply the credit towards your new plan.
