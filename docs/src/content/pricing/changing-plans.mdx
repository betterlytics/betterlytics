# Changing Your Plan

Already have a paid Betterlytics subscription and need to adjust your plan? This guide covers everything you need to know about upgrading, downgrading, and switching between plan tiers.

## Understanding Plan Changes

### Types of Plan Changes

**Upgrading:**

- Increase your event limits
- Switch from Growth to Professional

**Downgrading:**

- Reduce your event limits to lower costs
- Switch from Professional to Growth

**Lateral Changes:**

- Same tier but different event volume
- Adjust pricing without changing features

## Before You Change Plans

### Assess Your Current Usage

1. **Review your event consumption** in User Settings â†’ Usage tab
2. **Check which features you actually use** (Professional vs Growth)
3. **Consider your future growth** - will you need more events next month?
4. **Evaluate dashboard usage** - do you need multiple dashboards and sites to monitor?
