# Session Replay Integration

Betterlytics captures privacy‑aware session replays from real users. Replays help you debug UX issues by watching what users actually experienced, alongside your analytics metrics.

## Quick start

### Using the script tag

Add `data-replay="true"` to your analytics script to enable replays. You can also control sampling and limits with additional attributes.

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://betterlytics.io/analytics.js"
  data-site-id="your-siteid"
  data-server-url="https://betterlytics.io/track"
  data-replay="true"
  data-replay-sample="20"           
  data-replay-min-duration="5"      
  data-replay-idle-cutoff="600"     
  data-replay-max-duration="1200"   
  data-dynamic-urls="/product/**,/user/*/settings" 
  data-disable-replay-on-urls="/admin/**,/billing/**"
>
</script>
```

- **data-replay**: turn session replay on.
- **data-replay-sample**: percentage of traffic to record (0–100). If omitted or invalid, defaults to 0 (off).
- **data-replay-min-duration**: minimum seconds required before we upload a replay (prevents ultra‑short sessions). Default 15s.
- **data-replay-idle-cutoff**: seconds of no activity before we automatically stop and finalize. Default 600s.
- **data-replay-max-duration**: maximum seconds to record before we stop and finalize. Default 1200s.
- **data-dynamic-urls**: comma‑separated patterns to normalize SPA routes (supports `*` and `**`) for better grouping.
- **data-disable-replay-on-urls**: comma‑separated patterns where replay is disabled (privacy‑sensitive areas, admin, billing, etc.).

## What gets collected

When enabled, the tracker records:

- DOM snapshots and incremental updates
- Mouse interactions, selections, scrolls
- Inputs (values masked), media interactions, and navigation markers

Privacy defaults (what we mask by default):

- All text content in the page
- All form input values (passwords, emails, numbers, search, selects, etc.)
- Content in `contenteditable` elements

How to control visibility:

- Mask additional elements by adding the attribute `[data-rrweb-mask]` to any element in your app.
- Block entire regions from recording by adding the class `.rr-block`.
- Ignore non‑essential elements and events by adding the class `.rr-ignore`.

You can opt‑out on specific pages using `data-disable-replay-on-urls`.

## Availability

- Replays are uploaded in the background while the session is active.
- They typically appear in the dashboard shortly after the user leaves the page or becomes inactive.
- Sessions include duration, size, and a start URL to help you identify them.

## Duration, idle and sampling

- We stop recording when either:
  - no activity has occurred for `data-replay-idle-cutoff` seconds, or
  - total recording time exceeds `data-replay-max-duration` seconds.
- Finalization only happens if `data-replay-min-duration` is met.
- Sampling: if `data-replay-sample` is set to `N`, only approximately N% of eligible sessions will record.

## SPA behavior and route changes

- We emit a custom `Pageview` event and may capture a fresh snapshot on client‑side navigations to make timelines meaningful on SPAs.
- Use `data-dynamic-urls` to normalize variable path segments for aggregation (e.g. `/product/**`).

## Disabling on sensitive pages

Use `data-disable-replay-on-urls` patterns to disable recording on routes like `/admin/**`, `/settings/security`, or payment flows.

```html
<script
  ...
  data-disable-replay-on-urls="/admin/**,/billing/**,/settings/security"
></script>
```

## Best practices

- Start with low sampling (5–10%) and increase gradually.
- Keep `idle-cutoff` and `max-duration` conservative to reduce cost.
- Use route disabling for sensitive flows (auth, billing, support tools).
- Use `[data-rrweb-mask]`, `.rr-block`, and `.rr-ignore` in your app markup to protect sensitive UI parts.
