# Outbound Links Integration

Track when users click links that take them off your site. Use this to understand referral traffic you send to partners, social platforms, or external resources.

## Quick start

### Using the script tag

Set the `data-outbound-links` attribute on your analytics script. Supported values:

- `off` – disable outbound link tracking
- `domain` – only the external origin (default)
- `full` – origin + path

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://betterlytics.io/analytics.js"
  data-site-id="your-siteid"
  data-server-url="https://betterlytics.io/track"
  data-outbound-links="domain"
></script>
```

### Using the npm package

Outbound links are enabled by default, you can select the mode to specify what data is collected:

```ts
import betterlytics from '@betterlytics/tracker';

betterlytics.init('your-site-id', {
  outboundLinksMode: 'domain', // 'domain' (default) | 'full'
});
```

To collect full URLs, change the mode to `full`:

```ts
betterlytics.init('your-site-id', {
  outboundLinksMode: 'full',
});
```

To disable the collection of outbound links:

```ts
betterlytics.init('your-site-id', {
  disableOutboundLinks: true,
});
```

## What gets collected

When enabled, clicks on `<a>` elements that navigate to a different hostname are captured as `outbound_link` events.

- `domain` mode: only the external origin (e.g., `https://youtube.com`)
- `full` mode: origin + path (e.g., `https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)

<Callout type="warning">
Privacy note: Consider using `domain` mode to avoid sending full paths that may contain sensitive information.
</Callout>

## Verification

- Click an external link; in the dashboard, go to **Dashboard > Outbound Links**
- Use a broader time range if you don’t see data immediately

## Troubleshooting

- **No events:** Ensure the attribute or addon is set correctly, and the link host differs from your current site host.
- **Custom link components:** Ensure clicks bubble to an anchor element or dispatch the event yourself.

**Next steps**: Explore your [Outbound Links dashboard](/dashboard/outbound-links) to analyze destinations and click trends.
