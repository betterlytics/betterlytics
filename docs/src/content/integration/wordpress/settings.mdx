# Settings

The Betterlytics WordPress plugin settings are found at **Settings > Betterlytics** in your WordPress admin area. This page covers the core settings that control how Betterlytics works on your site.

---

## Enable Tracking

The **Enable Tracking** toggle controls whether Betterlytics collects data on your site.

### How it works

When tracking is enabled, the Betterlytics tracking script is injected into the footer of your website. This allows Betterlytics to collect page views and other configured events.

| State | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Enabled** (default) | The tracking script is loaded and data is collected |
| **Disabled** | The tracking script is completely removed from your site's source code. No data will be sent to Betterlytics |

<Callout type="tip">
Disabling tracking is useful for maintenance periods, staging environments, or when you need to temporarily pause data collection without deactivating the plugin.
</Callout>

## Site ID

The **Site ID** is the unique identifier that links your WordPress site to your Betterlytics dashboard.

### Where to find it

You can find your Site ID in your Betterlytics account:

1. Log in to [Betterlytics Dashboards](https://betterlytics.io/dashboards)
2. Locate the specific dashboard card for your site
3. The Site ID is displayed under the site name

### Important notes

<Callout type="warning">
If the Site ID is incorrect, data will not be recorded in your dashboard. Ensure you copy it exactly as shown in your account.
</Callout>

- The Site ID is case-sensitive
- Do not include any extra spaces before or after the ID
- Each site in your Betterlytics account has a unique Site ID
