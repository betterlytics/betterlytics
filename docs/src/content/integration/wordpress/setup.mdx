## Step 5: Configure Event Tracking (Optional)

The **Settings** tab lets you enable additional tracking features:

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **404 Tracking** | Know when visitors hit broken pages |
| **Search Tracking** | See what visitors search for on your site |
| **Web Vitals** | Monitor your site's performance scores |
| **Outbound Links** | Track which external links visitors click |
| **Downloads** | Track file downloads (PDFs, ZIPs, etc.) |
| **Custom HTML Attribute Events** | Track clicks on specific elements |

All event tracking is **opt-in** and disabled by default. Enable only what you need. Learn more about each feature in our [Events documentation](/integration/wordpress/events).
