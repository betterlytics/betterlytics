# Event Tracking

The Betterlytics WordPress plugin includes built-in tracking for common events. All events documented here are sent as [custom events](/integration/custom-events) and appear in the Events section of your Betterlytics dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
For additional event tracking options like Core Web Vitals, outbound links, and CSS class-based events, see the [Integration guides](/integration).

## 404 Tracking

**404 Error Tracking** allows you to see when visitors land on pages that don't exist on your site. This is helpful for identifying broken links or incorrect URLs.

### How it works

404 tracking uses a hybrid approach to ensure reliable capture of error pages:

1. **Backend Detection**: The plugin hooks into the WordPress `template_redirect` action and uses the native `is_404()` function to detect if the current request is resulting in a "Page Not Found" state.
2. **Event Queuing**: If a 404 is detected, the requested URL path is added to a queue.
3. **Frontend Firing**: During page render, a JavaScript snippet processes the queue and sends the event to Betterlytics.

This approach is more reliable than pure client-side detection because it hooks directly into the WordPress routing logic.

### Event data

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Event Name** | `404` |
| **Properties** | `path` - The full URL path that caused the error (e.g., `/non-existent-page`) |

### Example payload

```json
{
  "event": "404",
  "properties": {
    "path": "/broken-link-example"
  }
}
```

### Common use cases

- **Find broken internal links** - Identify pages on your site linking to non-existent content
- **Detect external broken links** - See when other sites link to pages you've moved or deleted
- **Monitor after migrations** - Track 404s after changing your URL structure
- **Catch typos** - Find common URL typos visitors make when trying to reach your content

## Site Search

**Site Search Tracking** gives you insights into what your visitors are searching for on your website.

### How it works

Site search tracking integrates directly with the WordPress search engine:

1. **Backend Detection**: The plugin hooks into the WordPress `template_redirect` action and uses `is_search()` to determine if the visitor is viewing a search results page.
2. **Query Extraction**: If a search is active, the plugin retrieves the query string using the native `get_search_query()` function.
3. **Event Firing**: The search query is sent to your Betterlytics dashboard.

This ensures that only actual WordPress searches are tracked, and the query is sanitized according to your WordPress settings.

### Event data

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Event Name** | `search` |
| **Properties** | `query` - The keyword or phrase the visitor searched for |

### Example payload

```json
{
  "event": "search",
  "properties": {
    "query": "pricing plans"
  }
}
```

### Privacy Option

By default, the search query term is **not** included in the event. Enable the **Include Search Query** checkbox in settings (or `track_search.include_query` in the [configuration JSON](/integration/wordpress/configuration)) to send query terms.

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Disabled** (default) | Only the search event is tracked, query is not sent |
| **Enabled** | Search query term is included with events |

<Callout type="info">
This is disabled by default as a privacy safeguard - users might search for personal information like names or emails on some sites.
</Callout>

### Common use cases

- **Content gap analysis** - Discover topics visitors want but can't find
- **Navigation improvement** - Identify content that's hard to find through your menu
- **Content prioritization** - See which topics generate the most search interest
- **Search quality monitoring** - Track what visitors search for to improve your search results

## File Downloads

**File Download Tracking** automatically tracks when visitors download files from your website.

### How it works

Unlike 404 and search tracking, file download tracking is handled entirely on the client side:

1. **Event Listener**: The plugin attaches a click event listener to the document.
2. **Element Inspection**: When a user clicks a link, the script inspects the `href` attribute.
3. **Extension Matching**: The script checks if the file extension matches a list of supported download formats.
4. **Event Firing**: If a match is found, the download event is sent to Betterlytics.

This approach ensures that all download links are tracked automatically, even those pointing to external servers or added dynamically via JavaScript.

### Supported file types

| Category | Extensions |
|----------|------------|
| **Documents** | `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx` |
| **Archives** | `.zip`, `.rar`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.dmg` |
| **Executables** | `.exe` |

### Event data

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Event Name** | `file-download` |
| **Properties** | `url` - The full source URL of the file |
| | `filename` - The name of the file extracted from the URL path |

### Example payload

```json
{
  "event": "file-download",
  "properties": {
    "url": "https://example.com/documents/annual-report-2024.pdf",
    "filename": "annual-report-2024.pdf"
  }
}
```

### Common use cases

- **Track resource popularity** - See which PDFs, guides, or documents get downloaded most
- **Measure content ROI** - Understand which downloadable content drives engagement
- **Monitor software downloads** - Track application or installer downloads
- **Audit external file links** - See when visitors download files hosted elsewhere
