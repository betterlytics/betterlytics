# Dashboard Overview

Your main dashboard page is the central hub for monitoring your website's performance. It provides a comprehensive overview of your key metrics through interactive charts and summary tables, giving you immediate insights into visitor behavior and website trends.

## Main Dashboard Components

When you first land on your dashboard, you'll see several key sections organized for maximum insight:

### 1. Key Metrics Summary Cards

At the top of your dashboard, four interactive metric cards display your most important KPIs:

- **Unique Visitors** - The number of distinct visitors to your website
- **Total Pageviews** - Total pages viewed across all sessions
- **Bounce Rate** - Percentage of sessions with only one page view
- **Average Visit Duration** - How long visitors typically stay on your site

<Callout type="info">
**Interactive Feature**: Click any summary card to display that metric in the main chart below. Each card shows a mini sparkline chart and changes the main visualization to focus on your selected metric.

</div>

### 2. Interactive Time-Series Chart

The main chart, shown in the image above, dynamically displays your selected metric over time, with several interactive features:

- **Responsive to Summary Cards** - Automatically updates when you click different metric cards
- **Time Period Comparison** - Shows current vs. previous period data with dashed comparison lines
- **Hover Details** - Detailed tooltips show exact values and percentage changes
- **Flexible Time Ranges** - Adapts to your selected date range with appropriate granularity

### 3. Summary Tables Overview

Below the main chart, you'll find a collection of five summary tables that provide quick insights into different aspects of your website traffic:

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", margin: "20px 0" }}>
  ![Dashboard Overview Summary Tables](/images/dashboard/dashboard-overview-summary-tables.png)
</div>

Each of the five summary tables (Top Pages, Geography, Devices Breakdown, Traffic Sources, and Custom Events) features its own set of tabs. 
These tabs allow you to drill down into different aspects of the data within that category. 
For example, under **Top Pages**, you can switch between Pages, Entry Pages, and Exit Pages. 
Use the tabs at the top of each table to explore the specific insights available.

#### Top Pages
- **Pages**: Most visited pages ranked by unique visitors
- **Entry Pages**: Common landing pages where visitors first arrive
- **Exit Pages**: Pages where visitors most often leave your site

#### Geography
- **Countries**: Visitor breakdown by country with exact visitor counts
- **World Map**: Interactive world map visualization showing global traffic distribution

#### Devices Breakdown
- **Browsers**: What browsers your visitors use (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- **Devices**: Device types (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
- **Operating Systems**: OS distribution (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, etc.)

#### Traffic Sources
- **Referrers**: Specific websites that send traffic to you
- **Sources**: Categorized traffic sources (Google, Facebook, direct, etc.)
- **Channels**: Traffic channels (Organic Search, Social Media, Direct, etc.)

#### Custom Events
- **Events**: Your custom tracked events (button clicks, form submissions, etc.)

<Callout type="tip">
**Visual Design**: Each table uses progress bars to show relative values at a glance, making it easy to spot your top-performing pages, countries, or traffic sources without looking at exact numbers. Hover over the progress bars to see the exact numbers and percentage of total occurrences.

## Dashboard Filters

All data on your overview page respects your dashboard filters:
