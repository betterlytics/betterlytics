# Campaign Analytics

Track and analyze traffic from your marketing campaigns using UTM parameters. View campaign performance metrics, audience demographics, and detailed breakdowns to understand which campaigns drive the most engagement.

## UTM Parameters

Campaigns are identified by the `utm_campaign` parameter in your URLs. Only the `utm_campaign` parameter is required for campaigns to appear on this page.

Example URL: `https://yourwebsite.com/page?utm_campaign=spring-sale`

Optional parameters like `utm_source` and `utm_medium` are highly recommended to provide additional context in the detailed breakdown views.

## Accessing Campaign Analytics

Navigate to **Dashboard > Campaigns** to view your campaign performance data.

## Campaign List View

The Campaigns page displays a list of all your tracked campaigns. Each campaign appears as an expandable card showing key performance metrics.

- **Campaign Name** - The utm_campaign parameter value used in your URLs
- **Sessions** - Total number of sessions attributed to this campaign
- **Bounce Rate** - Percentage of sessions that viewed only one page
- **Avg. Session Duration** - Average time visitors spent on your site from this campaign
- **Pages per Session** - Average number of pages viewed per session

### UTM Breakdown

The expanded view includes tabbed tables showing:

- **Source Breakdown** - Traffic sources (google, facebook, email, etc.) driving sessions to this campaign
- **Landing Pages** - Shows which pages visitors first arrive on from this campaign and highlights how each entry page performs.

### Audience Profile

View the demographic and technical profile of visitors from each campaign:

- **Devices** - Mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop distribution
- **Countries** - Geographic distribution of campaign visitors
- **Browsers** - Which browsers campaign visitors use
- **Operating Systems** - OS preferences of campaign visitors

### Tabbed Charts

Interactive charts provide lightweight visual breakdowns of UTM parameters and audience data for deeper insights into campaign performance.


## Time Range Filtering

Use the global time range selector at the top of the page to analyze campaign performance for specific periods:

- **Last 7 days**
- **Last 30 days**
- **Last 90 days**
- **Custom date ranges**

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** Advanced filtering options for campaigns are not yet available. Currently, you can only filter by time range. Campaign-specific filters will be added in a future update.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Data Not Appearing
- **Check UTM parameters**: Ensure `utm_campaign` parameter is correctly added to your URLs
- **Verify implementation**: Simply click on your UTM tagged link and check your Betterlytics Dashboard. Your visit should immediately appear in your campaign analytics.

The more UTM parameters you add to your campaign URLs, the richer your insights become. Don't be shy with `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_term`, and `utm_content`!
