# Filtering

Betterlytics provides comprehensive filtering capabilities across all dashboard pages, allowing you to analyze specific segments of your data and gain deeper insights into your website's performance. Filters help you focus on what matters most to your business.

## Overview

Filters are applied consistently across all dashboard pages and affect all data displayed on that page. When you apply filters, you're essentially asking "Show me data for visitors who match these specific criteria."

## How Filtering Works

### Universal Application

Filters are applied to **all data** on the current dashboard page, including:
- Visitor counts and unique visitor calculations
- Page view metrics and page analytics
- Session metrics (bounce rate, session duration)
- Device and browser breakdowns
- Geographic distributions
- Referrer analysis
- Custom event analytics
- Time-series charts and trend analysis

### Consistent Interface

Every dashboard page (except Campaign) includes the same filtering interface:
- **Filter button** in the top-right corner of each page
- **Active filters** displayed as badges below the filter button
- **Same filter options** available across all pages

## Available Filters

### Page & Navigation
- **URL** - Filter by specific page URLs or URL patterns

### Device Information
- **Device** - Desktop, mobile, tablet
- **Browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.
- **Operating system** - Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, etc.

### Geographic Data
- **Country** - Filter by visitor's country

### Traffic Sources
- **Referrer source** - Direct, search, social media, etc.
- **Referrer name** - Specific source names like "Google", "Facebook"
- **Referrer term** - Search keywords that brought users to your site
- **Referrer URL** - Complete referrer URLs

### Campaign Tracking
- **UTM source** - UTM source parameter values
- **UTM medium** - UTM medium parameter values
- **UTM campaign** - UTM campaign parameter values
- **UTM term** - UTM term parameter values
- **UTM content** - UTM content parameter values

### Custom Events
- **Type** - Page views or custom events
- **Event** - Specific custom event names

## Filter Operators

### Basic Operators
- **is** - Exact match (case-insensitive)
- **is not** - Exclude exact match (case-insensitive)

### Wildcard Matching

Use the asterisk (`*`) character for flexible pattern matching:

**Pattern Types:**
- `*example` - Matches anything ending with "example"
- `example*` - Matches anything starting with "example"
- `*example*` - Matches anything containing "example"

**Common Examples:**
- **URL is `/blog/*`** - All blog pages
- **Browser is `*Chrome*`** - All Chrome variants
- **UTM source is `*google*`** - All Google traffic sources
- **Event is `*click*`** - All click-related events

## Using Filters

### Adding Filters

1. Click the **Filters** button on any dashboard page
2. In the filter dropdown, click **Add your first filter** or **Add filter**
3. Select the **column** you want to filter by
4. Choose the **operator** (is/is not)
5. Enter the **value** to filter for
6. Click **Apply** to activate the filter

### Managing Multiple Filters

- **Add multiple filters** - Click "Add filter" to combine multiple criteria
- **All filters use AND logic** - Visitors must match ALL filters to be included
- **Remove filters** - Click the X button next to any filter in the dropdown
- **Clear all filters** - Remove all filters and click Apply

### Active Filter Display

Applied filters are shown as badges below the filter button:
- **Blue badges** show active filters
- **Click any badge** to quickly remove that specific filter
- **Hover over badges** to see full filter details

## Filter Examples

### E-commerce Analysis
**Mobile shoppers from the US:**
- Device is `mobile`
- Country is `US`
- URL is `/shop*`

**Abandoned cart analysis:**
- URL is `/cart`
- Event is not `purchase_completed`

### Content Performance
**Blog engagement from search:**
- URL is `/blog/*`
- Referrer source is `search`
- Referrer term is `*marketing*`

### Campaign Analysis
**Facebook ad performance:**
- UTM source is `facebook`
- UTM medium is `cpc`
- Device is not `desktop`

### Geographic Insights
**European mobile users:**
- Country is `DE` OR Country is `FR` OR Country is `UK`
- Device is `mobile`

*Note: Use separate filters for each country as filters use AND logic*

## Best Practices

### Effective Filtering Strategies

1. **Start broad, then narrow** - Begin with one filter and add more specific criteria
2. **Use wildcards effectively** - Leverage `*` for flexible pattern matching
3. **Combine related filters** - Group filters that make sense together
4. **Test filter combinations** - Experiment with different combinations to find insights
5. **Save URLs** - Filtered views create shareable URLs for bookmarking

### Common Filter Patterns

**Performance Analysis:**
- Filter by device type to optimize for mobile/desktop
- Filter by country to understand regional differences
- Filter by referrer to analyze traffic source quality

**Content Analysis:**
- Filter by URL patterns to analyze section performance
- Filter by custom events to track specific user actions
- Filter by time ranges combined with content filters

**User Behavior:**
- Filter by browser to identify technical issues
- Filter by referrer terms to understand search intent
- Filter by device + location for targeted insights

## Filter Limitations

### Current Restrictions

- **Campaign page** does not support query filters (only time range filters)
- **AND logic only** - All filters must match (no OR operations)
- **No nested conditions** - Cannot create complex filter hierarchies
- **Case-insensitive matching** - All text matching is case-insensitive

### Working with Limitations

**For OR conditions:**
- Apply filters one at a time to analyze different segments
- Use wildcards to capture multiple variations in one filter
- Create separate filtered views for different conditions

**For complex analysis:**
- Use multiple browser tabs with different filter combinations
- Export data for external analysis when needed
- Combine time range filters with query filters for deeper insights

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

- **Check filter values** - Ensure values match your actual data exactly
- **Try wildcards** - Use `*` if you're unsure of exact values
- **Remove filters gradually** - Remove filters one by one to identify the issue
- **Check time range** - Ensure your time range contains data for the filtered criteria

### Unexpected Results

- **Verify filter logic** - Remember all filters use AND logic
- **Check case sensitivity** - Filters are case-insensitive
- **Confirm wildcard usage** - Ensure `*` is placed correctly in your patterns
- **Review active filters** - Double-check all applied filters in the dropdown

### Performance Issues

- **Avoid overly broad wildcards** - `*` alone can be slow on large datasets
- **Use specific time ranges** - Shorter time ranges with filters perform better
- **Combine filters wisely** - More specific filters generally perform better
