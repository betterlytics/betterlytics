# World Map Analytics

The World Map provides a visual representation of where your website visitors are located around the world. This interactive map helps you understand your global audience distribution, identify key markets, and make data-driven decisions about international expansion, content localization, and regional marketing strategies.

## Accessing the World Map

Navigate to **Dashboard > Geography** to view your world map analytics data.

## What the World Map Shows

The world map displays **unique visitors** (not page views) by country, giving you insight into your actual audience reach rather than just activity volume. Each country is color-coded based on the number of unique visitors from that location during your selected time period.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", margin: "20px 0" }}>

</div>

<Callout type="info">
The map shows **unique visitors** - meaning each person is counted only once per country, regardless of how many pages they visited. This gives you a true picture of your geographic audience reach.

See [Metrics Glossary](/dashboard/metrics-glossary) for more information on how unique visitors are calculated.

## Data Accuracy and Sources

### Geographic Detection

**How Location is Determined:**

### Data Considerations

**VPN and Proxy Users:**
- **Masked locations** - Users with VPNs may appear from different countries
- **Business networks** - Corporate networks may show different locations
- **Privacy tools** - Some privacy-focused browsers may affect location accuracy

## Dashboard Filters

The world map respects all dashboard filters, allowing you to segment and analyze your geographic data:

- **Time Range** - View geographic distribution across different periods
- **Query Filters** - Segment geographic data by device type, traffic source, or custom criteria
- **Comparison Periods** - See how your geographic reach has changed over time

## Interpreting Your Geographic Data

### Audience Insights

**High Concentration Markets:**
- **Primary markets** - Countries with the highest visitor counts
- **Market penetration** - Understanding your reach in key regions
- **Seasonal patterns** - Geographic trends that change over time

**Emerging Markets:**
- **Growing regions** - Areas with increasing visitor counts
- **Untapped potential** - Countries with low but growing traffic
- **Expansion opportunities** - Markets worth targeting for growth

### Regional Analysis

## Understanding Data Limitations

<Callout type="warning">
**Important Considerations:**

- **IP-based location** - Location is determined by IP address, which may not reflect exact user location
- **VPN usage** - Users with VPNs may appear from different countries than their actual location
- **Business networks** - Corporate users may show the location of their company's network
- **Mobile carriers** - Mobile traffic may show carrier network locations rather than exact user locations
- **Privacy tools** - Some browsers and privacy tools may affect location accuracy
