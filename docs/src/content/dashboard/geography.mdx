# World Map Analytics

The World Map provides a visual representation of where your website's visitors are located around the world. This interactive map helps you understand your global audience distribution, identify key markets, and make data-driven decisions about international expansion, content localization, and regional marketing strategies.

## Accessing the World Map

Navigate to **Dashboard > Geography** to view your world map analytics data.

A compact version of the world map is also available in the Dashboard Overview for a quick glance at visitor distribution.

## What the World Map Shows

The World Map visualizes unique visitors (not page views) by country, helping you understand your true audience reach rather than just overall activity.
Each country is color-coded based on the number of unique visitors from that location during the selected time period.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", margin: "20px 0" }}>

</div>

<Callout type="info">
The map shows **unique visitors** - each person is counted only once per country, no matter how many pages they viewed. This provides an accurate view of your geographic audience reach.

See the [Metrics Glossary](/dashboard/metrics-glossary) for details on how unique visitors are calculated.

## Map Features

### Interactive Country Data

**Country Visualization:**
  - **Color-coded countries** - Each country is shaded based on visitor volume
  - **Blue gradient scale** - Lighter blue indicates higher visitor counts
  - **Gray countries** - Locations with no visitors appear in gray

**Click to select a country**: Clicking on a country selects it and opens a popup with a detailed breakdown of that country’s data.

  - **Single selection** - Only one country can be selected at a time.
  - **Popup behavior** - A popup opens when you click a country and can be closed by clicking the country again or selecting another country.
  - **Unmarked territories** - Clicking on unmarked areas (e.g., oceans) will close any existing selection or popup.


**Hover information**: When hovering over a country, it will show a green border and a sticky tooltip with more detailed visitor data.
  - **Sticky tooltip** - The tooltip follows your cursor and displays additional information about the country.

## Data Accuracy and Sources

### Geographic Detection

**How Location is Determined:**
- **IP-based geolocation** - Visitor location is determined from their IP address
- **Country-level precision** - Data is aggregated at the country level
- **GeoIP database** - Uses [MaxMind GeoLite2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases) database for accurate location mapping

### Data Considerations

**VPN and Proxy Users:**
- **Masked locations** - Users with VPNs may appear from different countries
- **Business networks** - Corporate networks may show different locations
- **Privacy tools** - Some privacy-focused browsers may affect location accuracy

## Dashboard Filters

The world map respects all dashboard filters, allowing you to segment and analyze your geographic data:

- **Time Range** - View geographic distribution across different periods
- **Query Filters** - Segment geographic data by device type, traffic source, or custom criteria
- **Comparison Periods** - See how your geographic reach has changed over time

## Interpreting Your Geographic Data

### Audience Insights

- **Primary markets** - Countries with the highest visitor counts
- **Market penetration** - Understanding your reach in key regions
- **Seasonal patterns** - Geographic trends that change over time

**Emerging Markets:**

- **Untapped potential** - Countries with low but growing traffic
- **Expansion opportunities** - Markets worth targeting for growth

### Regional Analysis

- **Business networks** - Corporate users may show the location of their company's network
- **Mobile carriers** - Mobile traffic may show carrier network locations rather than exact user locations
- **Privacy tools** - Some browsers and privacy tools may affect location accuracy
