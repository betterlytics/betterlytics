# Email Reports

Email reports deliver a summary of your website's analytics directly to your inbox on a recurring schedule. Get a snapshot of key metrics, top-performing pages, and traffic sources without having to log in to the dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
Email reports are available on **Professional** and **Enterprise** plans.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Email Reports

Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Reports** to configure your email reports.

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot of the Reports settings page */}

You can set up two types of reports independently:

### Weekly Reports

- **Toggle**: Enable or disable weekly report delivery
- **Report day**: Choose which day of the week to receive the report (Monday through Sunday)
- **Recipients**: Add up to 5 email addresses

Weekly reports cover the **previous 7 days** of analytics data and include comparisons to the 7 days before that, so you can quickly spot trends.

### Monthly Reports

- **Toggle**: Enable or disable monthly report delivery
- **Recipients**: Add up to 5 email addresses

Monthly reports are sent on the **1st of each month** and cover the entire previous month, with comparisons to the month before that.

## Managing Recipients

Each report type has its own recipient list. You can add up to **5 email addresses** per report type.

To add a recipient, type an email address into the input field and press **Enter** or click **Add**. To remove a recipient, click the remove button next to their address.

## What's Included in the Report

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot of an example email report */}

Each email report contains:

### Key Metrics

- **Visitors**: unique visitor count with percentage change from the previous period
- **Page Views**: total page views with trend indicator
- **Sessions**: session count with trend indicator
- **Bounce Rate**: percentage of single-page sessions
- **Average Visit Duration**: how long visitors spent on your site

Trend indicators show whether each metric went up, down, or stayed the same compared to the previous period.

### Top Pages

A ranked list of up to **10 pages** with the most page views during the reporting period.

### Top Traffic Sources

A ranked list of up to **10 referral sources** driving the most visits, such as Google, social platforms, or direct traffic.

## When Reports Are Sent

Reports are sent at **8:00 AM UTC** on the scheduled day:

- **Weekly**: On your chosen day of the week
- **Monthly**: On the 1st of each month

<Callout type="info">
Reports are based on UTC time. Depending on your time zone, you may receive the email on a slightly different calendar day.
</Callout>

## Permissions

Only dashboard members with the **Owner** or **Admin** role can configure email report settings. See your dashboard's member settings to manage roles.

## Troubleshooting

### Not receiving reports

- Verify that reports are enabled in **Settings > Reports**
- Check that your email address is listed as a recipient
- Look in your spam or junk folder
- Ensure your plan includes email reports (Professional or Enterprise)

### Report data looks empty

- Reports require analytics data from the reporting period: if your site had no traffic during the reporting period, the report will reflect that
- Confirm your tracking script is installed and collecting data
