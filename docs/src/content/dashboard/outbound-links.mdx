# Outbound Links in Your Dashboard

Outbound link analytics shows which external destinations your visitors click. Use this to understand partner engagement, social traffic you send, or which resources attract attention.

## Accessing Outbound Links

Go to **Dashboard > Outbound Links**. Filters and time range at the top affect all data on this page.

## Charts Section

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", margin: "20px 0" }}>
  ![Outbound Links Charts And Tables](/images/dashboard/outbound-links-charts-and-tables.png)
</div>


## What you’ll see

- **Outbound Links Distribution** – top external links as a distribution
- **Trend chart** – clicks over time for outbound links
- **Distribution breakdown** – share of clicks by destination


## Modes: domain vs full URL

Outbound links can be collected in two modes:

- **Domain**: only the origin is captured (example: `https://youtube.com`)
- **Full**: origin + path is captured (example: `https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)

<Callout type="warning">
Privacy note: Prefer **domain** mode to avoid collecting full paths that may contain sensitive information.
</Callout>

## Filtering

Use dashboard filters to analyze segments:

- Time range
- Query filters like Country, Device, Browser, OS, URL patterns

## Troubleshooting

- **No data**: Ensure outbound link tracking is enabled in your snippet or npm init ([see Integration docs](/integration/outbound-links)) and test with a link to a different hostname.
- **Custom links**: If you wrap anchors in custom components, ensure clicks bubble to an `<a>` element.
