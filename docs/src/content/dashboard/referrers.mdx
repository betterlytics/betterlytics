# Referrer Analytics

The Referrers page provides comprehensive insights into where your website visitors come from. Understanding your traffic sources helps you optimize marketing campaigns, identify successful channels, and make data-driven decisions about where to focus your promotional efforts.

## Accessing Referrer Analytics

Navigate to **Dashboard > Referrers** to view your referrer analytics data.

## What Referrer Analytics Shows

The referrers page displays **referral sessions** (not individual page views) from external sources, giving you insight into how visitors discover your website. Each referral session represents a unique visitor session that originated from an external source during your selected time period.

<Callout type="info">
Referrer analytics shows **referral sessions** - meaning unique visitor sessions from external sources. Internal navigation between pages on your site is filtered out to focus on true traffic acquisition.

### Tabbed View

The referrer table is organized into tabs for easy analysis:

## Understanding Referrer Sources

### Direct Traffic

**What counts as Direct:**
- Typed URLs directly into the browser
- Bookmarked pages
- Links from apps that don't pass referrer information
- HTTPS to HTTP transitions (referrer stripped for security)

<Callout type="info">
**Direct Traffic Note:** Some traffic marked as "direct" may actually come from other sources due to privacy settings, mobile apps, or security policies that strip referrer information.
</Callout>

## Dashboard Filters

Referrer analytics respects all dashboard filters for detailed analysis:

- **Time Range** - Compare referrer patterns across different periods
- **Query Filters** - Segment referrer data by geography, device type, or custom criteria
- **Comparison Periods** - See how your referral sources have changed over time

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring
1. **Weekly source reviews** - Track changes in your top referral sources
2. **Campaign correlation** - Connect referral spikes to marketing activities
3. **Seasonal analysis** - Identify patterns related to industry cycles or events

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Double down on winners** - Invest more in high-performing referral sources
2. **Investigate anomalies** - Research unexpected traffic sources for new opportunities
3. **Improve weak performers** - Optimize underperforming channels or consider reallocating resources

## Privacy and Data Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
**Important Considerations:**

- **Referrer policies** - Some browsers and sites limit referrer information for privacy
- **HTTPS transitions** - Referrer data may be stripped when moving from HTTPS to HTTP
- **Mobile apps** - Traffic from mobile applications often appears as direct
- **Privacy tools** - Ad blockers and privacy browsers may affect referrer accuracy
- **Search privacy** - Some search engines limit or encrypt search term data
