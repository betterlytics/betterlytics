## Step 5: Configure Event Tracking (Optional)

The **Settings** tab lets you enable additional tracking features:

{/* TODO: Add image showing the Settings tab with event tracking options */}

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **404 Tracking** | Know when visitors hit broken pages |
| **Search Tracking** | See what visitors search for on your site |
| **Web Vitals** | Monitor your site's performance scores |
| **Outbound Links** | Track which external links visitors click |
| **Downloads** | Track file downloads (PDFs, ZIPs, etc.) |
| **CSS Events** | Track clicks on specific elements |

We've set sensible defaults, so you can skip this step and come back later. Learn more about each feature in our [Custom Events](/integration/custom-events), [Web Vitals](/integration/web-vitals), and [Outbound Links](/integration/outbound-links) guides.
