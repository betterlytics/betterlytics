# Self-Hosting Setup

Run Betterlytics entirely on your own infrastructure. Everything stays on your server!

All self-hosting files and configuration live in the [betterlytics-selfhost](https://github.com/betterlytics/betterlytics-selfhost) repository.

## Requirements

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your server
- A **domain name** pointed to your server
- Ports **80** and **443** open (standalone mode) or a reverse proxy configured

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/betterlytics/betterlytics-selfhost.git
cd betterlytics-selfhost
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script

The interactive setup script generates your `.env` file and any necessary Docker Compose overrides:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

<Callout type="info">
Prefer to configure manually? Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values yourself.
</Callout>

### 3. Start the Containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Your Betterlytics instance will be available at your configured domain within a minute or two. Once it's running, log in and follow the in-app integration guide to [add the tracking script to your website](/installation/cloud-hosting#step-3-install-your-tracking-script).

## Deployment Modes

### Standalone (Default)

The default mode provisions TLS certificates automatically via Let's Encrypt. Set `HTTP_SCHEME=https` (the default) and ensure ports 80 and 443 are accessible from the internet for ACME challenges and HTTPS traffic.

When using `setup.sh`, this is handled automatically. The script generates a `docker-compose.override.yml` that exposes the correct ports.

If you're doing a manual setup, create the `docker-compose.override.yml` and add the following:

```bash
services:
  betterlytics-selfhost:
    ports:
      - "${BIND_ADDRESS}:${HTTPS_PORT}:443"
```

### Behind a Reverse Proxy

If you already have a reverse proxy (Caddy, Nginx, Traefik, etc.), set `HTTP_SCHEME=http` and bind to localhost on a custom port so you don't expose port 80 directly:

```bash
HTTP_SCHEME=http
BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
HTTP_PORT=5566
```

Then point your reverse proxy to that port.

<Tabs items={['Caddy', 'Nginx', 'Traefik']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```
    analytics.example.com {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:5566
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name analytics.example.com;

        ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/analytics.example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/analytics.example.com/privkey.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5566;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Add a router and service in your Traefik dynamic configuration:

    ```yaml
    http:
      routers:
        betterlytics:
          rule: "Host(`analytics.example.com`)"
          entryPoints:
            - websecure
          tls:
            certResolver: letsencrypt
          service: betterlytics

      services:
        betterlytics:
          loadBalancer:
            servers:
              - url: "http://127.0.0.1:5566"
    ```

    If you use Docker labels instead of file-based configuration, add these to the Betterlytics service in your `docker-compose.override.yml`:

    ```yaml
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.betterlytics.rule=Host(`analytics.example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.betterlytics.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.betterlytics.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
      - "traefik.http.services.betterlytics.loadbalancer.server.port=5566"
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Updating

To update your self-hosted instance to the latest version:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### Containers won't start

- Verify Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running
- Check that required ports (80/443 in standalone mode) are not in use
- Review container logs: `docker compose logs`

### HTTPS certificate not provisioning

- Ensure your domain's DNS A record points to your server
- Ports 80 and 443 must be accessible from the internet
- Check the container logs for ACME errors: `docker compose logs`

### No analytics data appearing

- Verify the tracking script is installed on your website with the correct domain and site ID
- Check that the `/event` endpoint is reachable from the browser
- Review backend logs: `docker compose logs`
