# Cloud Hosting Setup

Get started with our hosted analytics service in under 60 seconds. No infrastructure management required!

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. **Visit** [betterlytics.io/signup](https://betterlytics.io/register)
2. **Sign up** with your email address
3. **Complete** your profile setup

## Step 2: Create Your Website Dashboard

1. **Click** "Create Dashboard" in your dashboard overview
2. **Enter** your domain name (e.g., `example.com`)
3. **Click** "Create Dashboard"

Your dashboard will now be created and you'll be automatically redirected to the dashboard.

## Step 3: Install Your Tracking Script

Once your dashboard is created, **click the "Integration" button** in your dashboard to access your personalized setup guide. Here you'll find your unique Site ID and a copy-to-clipboard tracking script.

The integration guide will walk you through adding our lightweight tracking script (under 1KB) to your website's `<head>` section. The script will look like this:

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://betterlytics.io/analytics.js"
  data-site-id="your-unique-site-id"
></script>
```

Follow the guide's platform-specific instructions for your tech stack (HTML, Next.js, React, etc.). The guide includes a real-time verification tool that will confirm when your installation is successful - you should see your first data appear within 1-2 minutes of installation.

## What's Next?

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** Once your tracking script is installed and verified, you're ready to start gathering insights about your visitors. Your dashboard will automatically begin showing:

- Real-time visitor activity
- Page view statistics
