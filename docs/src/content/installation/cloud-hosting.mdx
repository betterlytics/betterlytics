# Cloud Hosting Setup

Get started with our hosted analytics service in under 60 seconds. No infrastructure management required!

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. **Visit** [betterlytics.io/register](https://betterlytics.io/register)
2. **Sign up** with your email address
3. **Complete** your profile setup

## Step 2: Create Your Website Dashboard

1. **Click** "Create Dashboard" in your dashboard overview
2. **Enter** your domain name (e.g., `example.com`)
3. **Click** "Create Dashboard"

Your dashboard will now be created and you'll be automatically redirected to the dashboard.

## Step 3: Install Your Tracking Script

Once your dashboard is created, **click the "Integration" button** in your dashboard to access your personalized setup guide. Here you'll find your unique Site ID and your preferred integration method.

### Option 1: Use the Script Tag

The integration guide will walk you through adding our lightweight tracking script to your website's `<head>` section. The script will look like this:

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://betterlytics.io/analytics.js"
  data-site-id="your-unique-site-id"
  data-server-url="https://betterlytics.io/track"
></script>
```

This works great for plain HTML sites or if you want a no-code/low-code option.

Follow the guide's platform-specific instructions for your tech stack (HTML, Next.js, React, etc.). The guide includes a real-time verification tool that will confirm when your installation is successful - you should see your first data appear within 1-2 minutes of installation.

### Option 2: Use Our NPM Package (Recommended for React, Next.js, etc.)

For modern JavaScript frameworks, you can use our official NPM package.

You can install it using your favorite package manager:

<div style={{ marginBottom: '3rem' }}>
  <Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash
      npm install @betterlytics/tracker
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash
      pnpm add @betterlytics/tracker
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn add @betterlytics/tracker
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash
      bun add @betterlytics/tracker
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>

Then initialize it in your app:

```ts
import betterlytics from "@betterlytics/tracker";

betterlytics.init("your-site-id");
```

This is ideal for SPAs or component-based frameworks where script tags don't always play nice.
