      "intro": "We're building the future of web analytics: privacy-first, open source, and designed for the modern web. No more choosing between powerful insights and respecting your visitors' privacy.",
      "sections": {
        "howWeStarted": {
          "title": "How We Started",
          "p1": "Betterlytics was born out of real frustration. Our team was developing a Vendor Management System when we hit a wall with web analytics. Every solution we evaluated forced us into the same impossible choice: either compromise our users' privacy or settle for inadequate insights.",
          "p2": "Traditional analytics tools force you to choose between comprehensive insights and user privacy. We believe that's a false choice. Betterlytics proves you can have powerful, actionable analytics while being completely privacy-compliant and respectful of your visitors.",
          "p3": "What started as a solution for our own needs became something much bigger: a mission to build analytics tools that respect both website owners and their visitors. Every feature is designed with privacy and performance as equal priorities."
        },
        "whyPrivacyFirst": {
          "title": "Why Privacy-First Analytics Matter",
          "p1": "The web analytics industry has been dominated by surveillance capitalism for too long. Major analytics providers collect vast amounts of personal data, track users across websites, and use this information to build detailed behavioral profiles for advertising purposes.",
          "p2": "We don't believe website owners should have to compromise their visitors' privacy to understand how their site performs. Betterlytics collects only the essential metrics you need: no cookies, no personal data, no cross-site tracking. Your visitors' privacy is respected by default."
        },
        "builtInOpen": {
          "title": "Built in the Open",
          "p1": "Betterlytics is completely open source under the AGPL-3.0 license. This isn't just about transparency, it's about accountability. Anyone can inspect our code, verify our privacy claims, and contribute to making the platform better.",
          "p2": "Open source also means freedom. You can self-host Betterlytics on your own infrastructure, ensuring complete control over your data. No vendor lock-in, no surprise policy changes, no sudden price increases."
        },
        "privacyPerformance": {
          "title": "Privacy and Performance in Perfect Balance",
          "p1": "We obsess over both privacy and performance equally because your website's speed matters just as much as your visitors' privacy. Our tracking script weighs less than 2KB. Compare that to Google Analytics' bloated 45KB+ payload. Built with modern web standards and optimized for speed, Betterlytics won't slow down your site.",
          "p2": "Under the hood, we use cutting-edge technology: Rust for high-performance data processing, ClickHouse for lightning-fast analytical queries, and Next.js 15 for a modern, responsive dashboard experience. Every technical decision prioritizes both user privacy and system performance."
        },
        "builtForEveryone": {
          "title": "Built for Everyone",
          "p1": "Whether you're running a personal blog, a growing SaaS platform, an e-commerce store, or an enterprise website, Betterlytics is designed to meet your needs. We understand that different organizations have different requirements, from simple traffic insights to complex user journey analysis.",
          "p2": "Integration takes minutes, not hours. Our dashboard is intuitive and well-documented, showing you what you need to know without drowning you in unnecessary complexity. While we don't have a public API yet, every dashboard feature is thoroughly documented to help you get the most out of your analytics."
        },
        "privacyRegulations": {
          "title": "Privacy Regulations Made Simple",
          "p1": "GDPR, CCPA, PECR compliant. Privacy regulations shouldn't be a compliance nightmare. Because Betterlytics doesn't collect personal data or use cookies, you're compliant by default. No cookie banners required, no consent management needed.",
          "p2": "This simplicity extends to your users too. They can focus on your content instead of being interrupted by privacy notices and consent forms. Better experience for everyone.",
          "p3Prefix": "We're based in the European Union and all data processing occurs within EU boundaries. Your data never leaves the EU, ensuring full compliance with GDPR requirements. For detailed information about how we handle your data, see our",

        },
        "communityDriven": {
          "title": "Community-Driven Development",
          "p1": "Betterlytics grows through community feedback and contributions. We listen to developers, implement requested features, and maintain the platform based on real user needs; not investor demands or advertising revenue requirements. We want to deeply thank our community for their feedback and contributions.",
          "p2": "Our sustainable business model means we can focus on building the best analytics platform possible. We're funded by our users, not by selling their data. This alignment of incentives ensures we'll always prioritize privacy and performance and never compromise on either."

          "title": "The Future of Web Analytics",
          "quote": "We believe businesses should be able to understand their audience without sacrificing privacy or making needless compromises on ethics. Analytics can be both powerful and respectful by design.",
          "p1": "This vision drives everything we build. Every feature, every optimization, every decision is guided by our commitment to privacy-first analytics that everyone can trust and use."
