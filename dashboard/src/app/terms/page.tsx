                  <p className='text-muted-foreground text-sm'>
                    We offer a permanently free tier with a monthly event limit as specified on our pricing page.
                    No credit card is required for the free tier. We do not sell your data - ever, regardless of
                    which plan you use.

                    You can use our free tier indefinitely within the monthly event limits. For higher usage, you
                    need to upgrade to a paid plan and pay in advance. If you exceed plan limits without upgrading,
                    you risk losing excess data. If paid accounts become overdue, we will freeze the account until
                    payment is made.

                    Each plan includes a monthly limit of events (pageviews, custom events, etc.). Unused events do
                    not roll over to the next month. You will never be charged extra for occasional traffic spikes.
                    If you consistently exceed your plan limits for two consecutive months, we will contact you to
                    discuss upgrading.

                    loss resulting from plan downgrades.

                    but is retained for 1 month in case you return, then permanently deleted.
